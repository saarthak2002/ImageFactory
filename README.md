## Backend

Image factory's backend is powered by a custom REST API constructed using Node.js and Express with MongoDB as the database. The repository for the backend can be viewed [here](https://github.com/saarthak2002/ImageFactoryBackEnd).

# Generate Image View

The heart of the app is the Picture Factory. Here, the user can enter a prompt to generate their image. They may also select an aesthetic preset to be applied to their image. Once the API call finishes, the newly created image is displayed to the user. Then, the user may post the image to the Image Factory network along with a caption. The post view also offers a suggested caption which is generated by AI based on the image the user has created. The post will appear on the feed of all other users who follow the poster, along with the caption, prompt, and aesthetic used, so others can be inspired to create their own art. Viewers of the post can like and comment on it as well.

## Performance

Instead of storing images directly in the database, ImageFactory makes use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to optimize performance. Images are served via the ImageFactory REST API through links stored in the database from the Cloudinary API.
